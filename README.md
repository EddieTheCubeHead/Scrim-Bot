# Scrim-Bot
A bot meant for setting up scrims on a discord server.

This is a bot I started developing as my first bigger project. The main use of the bot is to ease organisation of scrim games on
the discord server I usually play on, but to keep myself occupied I have started implementing features I thought it might need in
the future.

If the project seems like something you could use please contact me for setup guidelines. I cannot provide hosting, being a poor student,
but the bot should be lightweight and can be run from a raspberry pi or even the computer you play on. To make using the bot easier I will
probably make the setup of the folders needed for the bot to run more automated later, but at the moment it requires some manual folder 
creation. I am also planning a wiki article about getting discord bot token and downloading the bot for less tech-savvy users. For the
time being, if you want to setup the bot for your own use, you can find my email in my profile, if you are a registered GitHub user.

As this is my first larger project I already see a lot of things I could improve and probably have missed even more chances of 
improvement. Constructive criticism is always welcome.
