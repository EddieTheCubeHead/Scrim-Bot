  beta 0.9.8:

Comment cleanup for all modules:
	-main (done)
	-scrim_methods (done)
	-elo_methods (done)
	-cogs (done)
		-scrim (done)
		-elo (done)
		-help (done)

Switch all variables to more readable naming scheme:
	-main (done)
	-scrim_methods (done)
	-elo_methods (done)
	-cogs (done)
		-scrim (done)
		-elo (done)
		-help (done)

Move as many repeated tasks to functions as possible

	DONE: scrim cog shortened from 1500loc to 1000loc while scrim_methods gained
	~100loc. Overall 400loc less

Play or simulate a full 10 player scrim on all team assignment methods ESPECIALLY
pick-up games to squash leftover bugs (done)


  1.0.0:

Test all team choosing modes (done)

Get and implement feedback on user-interface (done)

  1.1.0:

Bot admin functionality and server specific settings

Subscribing to scrims
	-Probably need to implement a (full-ish) role system based on games (done)
	-Registration message that is created on the same interactive command as roles (done)
		-Has one message with the roles as reactions. Assigns roles based on reactions. (done)
	-Automatic detection of existing registration channels/messages on startup (done)
	-Argument to ping the role of the current scrim's game when creating a scrim
	-Server-wide setting enable/disable automatic pinging when creating a scrim (default, false)
	-Command to have the bot ping the role of the scrim's game
		-This is better than pinging yourself because the message can be easily auto-deleted when the
		scrim ends and pinging rate can be reduced with a server-wide setting

Rewriting team management in code. 
	-Take a look at replacing class variable Scrim.participators with a set (done)
	-Possibly implementing a set of all participating players for each locked 
	scrim to make duplicating or losing participators of a specific scrim impossible (done)
	-Test the changed code for bugs
		-Squash them all
	-Possibly implement better error management for Scrim.set_missing_elos (should ideally tell
	which player caused the problem) (done)

Scrim usability improvements:
	- DONE: Delete messages when a scrim is ongoing
	- Autoprint scrim ip (/note can be used, as there isn't currently automatic hosting, done, kinda)
	- DONE: Automatically terminate a scrim after 15 minutes of no activity
